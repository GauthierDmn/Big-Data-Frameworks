## Question 1 : Select the number of names by origin ##

SELECT count(*), org FROM prenoms3 LATERAL VIEW explode(origin) adTable AS org GROUP BY org;

## Question 2 : Select the number of names by number of origin ##

SELECT size(origin), count(origin) FROM prenoms3 GROUP BY size(origin);

## Question 3 : Select the % of male names and % of female names ##
## Here I wrote two queries to facilitate the job but it is possible to do it in a single query ##
## The two requests are not so "pretty" because I did not manage to use a "select count(gender[0])/(select * from prenoms3) AS fract ..."
in my select request part. Hive may not support it? ##

SELECT table1.count/table2.count
FROM (SELECT
count(gender[0]) as count, 1 as id FROM prenoms3 WHERE gender[0]=="m" OR gender[1]=="m") table1
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT
count(gender[0]) as count, 1 as id FROM prenoms3) table2
ON table1.id = table2.id;

SELECT table1.count/table2.count
FROM (SELECT
count(gender[0]) as count, 1 as id FROM prenoms3 WHERE gender[0]=="f" OR gender[1]=="f") table1
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT
count(gender[0]) as count, 1 as id FROM prenoms3) table2
ON table1.id = table2.id;
